        <h1>Collaboration Playbook</h1>

        <div class=intro>
          <p>
            The Holy Grail of effective collaboration is in creating shared understanding about the problem and shared commitment to the possible solutions. Shared understanding is when stakeholders understand each other’s positions well enough to have intelligent dialog about the different interpretations of the problem, and to exercise collective intelligence about how to solve it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Research has shown that members working on complex projects are “less likely to share knowledge freely, to learn from one another, to shift workloads flexibly to break up unexpected bottlenecks, to help one another complete jobs and meet deadlines, and to share resources - in other words, to collaborate.”</p>
          <p>
            This playbook is made up of<span class="category_color activity">activities</span>, <span class="category_color article">articles</span> and <span class="category_color framework">frameworks</span> to help you through the 6 phases of the collaboration process efficiently and effectively. These 6 phases of collaboration were identified through various discussions and retrospectives about what facilitates and impedes collaboration.

              Communicating critical information, decisions, and learnings should not be an afterthought. If this information is not properly shared to the right audiences, alignment will not be reached, others will not be able to build on top of the project, and others will not learn from your successes and mistakes. Documenting key decisions, learnings, and follow up plans will help everyone stay informed and will avoid overlapping initiatives.
